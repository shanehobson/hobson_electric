                    The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is evolving daily, and we’d like to update you, our valued customers, to know that Hobson Electric is actively monitoring the situation.  Governor Holcomb issued a “Stay at Home” order effective at 11:59 pm March 24, 2020 thru 11:59 pm on April 6, 2020.  When this announcement was made, Hobson Electric had already voluntarily put into place its own stay at home policy, based on the guidelines set by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), which began at 10:00 pm on Sunday, March 22, 2020.  This decision was based on the fact that all the states bordering our state had already issued a Stay at Home Order. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our top priority is the health and safety of our team members, our customers, our vendors, and our community.  We are reaching out to our customers to assure everyone that Hobson Electric is following the guidelines set by the CDC.  The work we are allowed to perform is very limited because of the stay at home order, which states we can perform “Emergencies and Essential Work.”  Our business is not a work from home type of service, but again, we are limited on what we can do. We are also following the guidelines in the Governor’s Stay at Home document with regard to our employees.  We are having any employee who is sick stay at home until they are free of fever (without the use of medication) for at least 72 hours AND symptoms have improved for at least 72 hours AND at least seven days have passed since symptoms first began.  
                </p>    
                <p>
                    There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with the virus.  Infected people can spread COVID-19 through their respiratory secretions, especially when they cough or sneeze.  According to the DCD, spread from person-to-person is most likely among close contacts (about 6 feet).  Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.  These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.  It’s currently suggested that an infected person can spread COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. 
                </p>  
                <p>
                    Our business is listed under the “Critical Trades,” which allows us to operate, but, as quoted in the Governor’s order, we can only “provide services that are necessary to maintaining the safety, sanitation, and essential operations of residences, Essential Activities, and Essential Businesses and Operations.”  Basically, we can serve any Essential business that has an emergency or essential job.  Essential business will remain open during the stay-at-home order to provide services that are vital to the lives of Hoosiers.  Any residential job, as I interpret the wording, would be permitted if there is an issue with a power outage or any other critical, life threatening issue, which would include the ability to prepare food.  Please call us if you have an electrical issue that meets this criteria.  I would add that if you have any electrical issue that you fear may be creating an unsafe environment in your home, please call us.  Your health and safety are of the utmost importance to us.  We want to assure everyone that we are still here for you and will maintain normal business hours.  Our dedicated staff is available to talk with you via phone during our normal hours of 7:30am-4:00pm during this stay at home time.
